## Demonstration Trajectory Generation 

For generating demonstration for toy control problems through trajectory optimization, we use pydrake. This custom [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14D8u36RauNort_PMrUYHtL7BTLVy290h?usp=sharing) comprises of the i)setup ii) trajectoy generation iii) Visualisation and iv) other boiler plates. At present it is ready for pendulumn, and one can easily download a zipped folder of the trajectory for a given set of dynamics and simulation config.
